In this lesson I learned and trained how to use images and links. 
I mainly used absolutes links because I was lazy to download and put the images in a file and then use a relative link . 
I also used unordered and ordered list . Heading and paragraphs to add content to my pages. 
I didn't really paid attention to the meaning of the webpages instead I treated it as a troll because I wanted to have some fun while doing this projet. 
I can say for sure that I enjoyed this small projet and in a future I will redid it to make it something more beautiful and serious. For now that's it. See you in the futur .
